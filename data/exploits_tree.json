The vulnerability is within the \"sreplace\" function within the \"src/support.c\" file. The off-by-one heap overflow bug in the ProFTPD sreplace function has been discovered about 2 (two) years ago by Evgeny Legerov. We tried to exploit this off-by-one bug via MKD command, but failed. We did not work on this bug since then. Actually, there are exists at least two bugs in sreplace function, one is the mentioned off-by-one heap overflow bug the other is a stack-based buffer overflow via 'sstrncpy(dst,src,negative argument)'. We were unable to reach the \"sreplace\" stack bug on ProFTPD 1.2.10 stable version, but the version 1.3.0rc3 introduced some interesting changes, among them: 1. another (integer) overflow in sreplace! 2. now it is possible to reach sreplace stack-based buffer overflow bug via the \"pr_display_file\" function! 3. stupid '.message' file display bug So we decided to choose ProFTPD 1.3.0 as a target for our exploit. To reach the bug, you need to upload a specially created .message file to a writeable directory, then do \"CWD <writeable directory>\" to trigger the invocation of sreplace function. Note that ProFTPD 1.3.0rc3 has introduced a stupid bug: to display '.message' file you also have to upload a file named '250'. ProFTPD 1.3.0 fixes this bug. The exploit is a part of VulnDisco Pack since Dec 2005.",

By sending data containing a large number of Telnet IAC commands, an attacker can corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code. The Debian Squeeze version of the exploit uses a little ROP stub to indirectly transfer the flow of execution to a pool buffer (the cmd_rec \"res\" in \"pr_cmd_read\"). The Ubuntu version uses a ROP stager to mmap RWX memory, copy a small stub to it, and execute the stub. The stub then copies the remainder of the payload in and executes it. NOTE: Most Linux distributions either do not ship a vulnerable version of ProFTPD, or they ship a version compiled with stack smashing protection. Although SSP significantly reduces the probability of a single attempt succeeding, it will not prevent exploitation. Since the daemon forks in a default configuration, the cookie value will remain the same despite some attempts failing. By making repeated requests, an attacker can eventually guess the cookie value and exploit the vulnerability. The cookie in Ubuntu has 24-bits of entropy. This reduces the effectiveness and could allow exploitation in semi-reasonable amount of time.",

CryptoLog's login.php endpoint is responsible for the login process. One of the user supplied parameters is used by the application without input validation and parameter binding, which leads to SQL injection vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this vulnerability gives a valid session. CryptoLog's logshares_ajax.php endpoint is responsible for executing an operation system command. It's not possible to access this endpoint without having a valid session. One user parameter is used by the application while executing an operating system command, which causes a command injection issue.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of the affected device as a high-privilege user. RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall versions prior to 1.2.2.1 are affected. RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router versions prior to 1.0.3.45 are affected. RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router versions prior to 1.3.1.1 are affected. Note: successful exploitation may not result in a session, and as such, on_new_session will never repair the HTTP server, leading to a denial-of-service condition.",

This vulnerability affects the HNAP SOAP protocol, which accepts arbitrarily long strings into certain XML parameters and then copies them into the stack. This exploit has been tested on the real devices DIR-818LW and 868L (rev. B), and it was tested using emulation on the DIR-822, 823, 880, 885, 890 and 895. Others might be affected, and this vulnerability is present in both MIPS and ARM devices. The MIPS devices are powered by Lextra RLX processors, which are crippled MIPS cores lacking a few load and store instructions. Because of this the payloads have to be sent unencoded, which can cause them to fail, although the bind shell seems to work well. For the ARM devices, the inline reverse tcp seems to work best. Check the reference links to see the vulnerable firmware versions.",

Details about these vulnerabilities can be found in the advisories listed in References. The Forensics web application is disabled in QRadar Community Edition, but the code still works, so these vulnerabilities can be exploited in all flavours of QRadar.

This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the `Events` feature of Pandora FMS. This flaw allows users to execute arbitrary commands via the `target` parameter in HTTP POST requests to the `Events` function. After authenticating to the target, the module attempts to exploit this flaw by issuing such an HTTP POST request, with the `target` parameter set to contain the payload. If a shell is obtained, the module will try to obtain the local MySQL database password via a simple `grep` command on the plaintext `/var/www/html/pandora_console/include/config.php` file. Valid credentials for a Pandora FMS account are required. The account does not need to have admin privileges.

The XML external entity vulnerability in the Autodiscover Servlet is used to read a Zimbra configuration file that contains an LDAP password for the 'zimbra' account. The zimbra credentials are then used to get a user authentication cookie with an AuthRequest message. Using the user cookie, a server side request forgery in the Proxy Servlet is used to proxy an AuthRequest with the 'zimbra' credentials to the admin port to retrieve an admin cookie. After gaining an admin cookie the Client Upload servlet is used to upload a JSP webshell that can be triggered from the web server to get command execution on the host. The issues reportedly affect Zimbra Collaboration Suite v8.5 to v8.7.11. This module was tested with Zimbra Release 8.7.1.GA.1670.UBUNTU16.64 UBUNTU16_64 FOSS edition.",

The vulnerability can only be exploited by an attacker on the LAN side of the router, but the attacker does not need any authentication to abuse it. After exploitation, an attacker will be able to execute any command as root, including downloading and executing a binary from another host. This vulnerability was discovered and exploited at Pwn2Own Tokyo 2019 by the Flashback team (Pedro Ribeiro + Radek Domanski). This module was updated in November 2020, after a bypass was discovered for the patch TP-Link issued. The new injection technique works on older firmware too. All firmware versions up to (but excluding) releases 201029 and 201030 are exploitable.",

During testing on Windows XP SP3, these protections successfully prevented exploitation. Testing was also done with mysql on Ubuntu 9.04. Although the vulnerable code is present, both version 5.5.0-m2 built from source and version 5.0.75 from a binary package were not exploitable due to the use of the compiler's FORTIFY feature.

The vulnerability was introduced by Debian and Ubuntu Redis packages that insufficiently sanitized the Lua environment. The maintainers failed to disable the package interface, allowing attackers to load arbitrary libraries. On a typical `redis` deployment (not docker), this module achieves execution as the `redis` user. Debian/Ubuntu packages run Redis using systemd with the \"MemoryDenyWriteExecute\" permission, which limits some of what an attacker can do. For example, staged meterpreter will fail when attempting to use mprotect. As such, stageless meterpreter is the preferred payload. Redis can be configured with authentication or not. This module will work with either configuration (provided you provide the correct authentication details). This vulnerability could theoretically be exploited across a few architectures: i386, arm, ppc, etc. However, the module only supports x86_64, which is likely to be the most popular version.",

When handling chained response packets, Samba fails to validate the offset value used when building the next part. By setting this value to a number larger than the destination buffer size, an attacker can corrupt memory. Additionally, setting this value to a value smaller than 'smb_wct' (0x24) will cause the header of the input buffer chunk to be corrupted. After close inspection, it appears that 3.0.x versions of Samba are not exploitable. Since they use an \"InputBuffer\" size of 0x20441, an attacker cannot cause memory to be corrupted in an exploitable way. It is possible to corrupt the heap header of the \"InputBuffer\", but it didn't seem possible to get the chunk to be processed again prior to process exit. In order to gain code execution, this exploit attempts to overwrite a \"talloc chunk\" destructor function pointer. This particular module is capable of exploiting the flaw on x86 Linux systems that do not have the nx memory protection.

The PHP file contains an encoded payload that allows for remote command execution on the target server. The zip archive can be uploaded via two vectors, the `Import New Language` function and the `Patcher` function. The module first uploads the archive via `Import New Language` and then attempts to execute the payload via an HTTP GET request to the PHP file in the root server directory. If no session is obtained, the module creates another zip archive and attempts exploitation via `Patcher`. Valid credentials for an ATutor admin account are required.

The server will rename this file to a random string. The module will therefore attempt to change the filename back to the original name via an HTTP POST request to `/admin/file-manager/rename`. For the `php` target, the payload is embedded in the uploaded file and the module attempts to execute the payload via an HTTP GET request to `/storage/file_name`. For the `linux` and `windows` targets, the module uploads a simple PHP web shell similar to `<?php system($_GET[\"cmd\"]); ?>`. Subsequently, it leverages the CmdStager mixin to deliver the final payload via a series of HTTP GET requests to the PHP web shell. Valid credentials for a HorizontCMS user with permissions to use the FileManager are required.

Jira versions between 6.3.5 and 6.4.10 are also affected by default, because they were bundled with a vulnerable copy of HipChat. When using the check command, if you supply a valid username and password, the module will be able to trigger the bug and check more accurately. If not, it falls back to passive, which can only tell if the target is running on a Jira version that is bundled with a vulnerable copy of Hipchat by default, which is less reliable. This vulnerability was originally discovered internally by Atlassian.",

The SQL injection can be used to achieve remote code execution as SYSTEM in Windows or as the user in Linux. This module exploits both PostgreSQL (newer builds) and MySQL (older or upgraded builds). MySQL targets are more reliable due to the use of relative paths; with PostgreSQL you should find the web root path via other means and specify it with WEB_ROOT. The injection is only exploitable via a GET request, which means that the payload has to be sent in chunks smaller than 8000 characters (URL size limitation). Small payloads and the use of exe-small is recommended, as you can only do between 10 and 20 injections before using up all the available ManagedConnections until the next server restart. This vulnerability exists in all versions released since 2006, however builds below DC v7 70200 and PMP v6 6500 do not ship with a JSP compiler.

A bug in the privileges system allows a teacher to add themselves as a manager to their own class. They can then add any other users, and thus look to add someone with manager privileges on the system (not just the class). After adding a system manager, a 'loginas' feature is used to access their account. Next the system is reconfigured to allow for all users to install an addon/plugin. Then a malicious theme is uploaded and creates an RCE. If all of that is a success, we revert permissions for managers to system default and remove our malicoius theme. Manual cleanup to remove students from the class is required. This module was tested against Moodle version 3.9",

Through a crafted POST request, it is possible to invoke particular database migration functions (i.e. functions that bring the existing database up-to-date with an updated codebase) by name and with particular parameters. 3. A particular migration function, core_drop_meta_for_table, allows a class parameter to be set which is used directly in a perl eval statement, allowing perl code injection.",

This module doesnt use the log inclusion method of exploitation due to it not being universal enough. Instead, a new code injection technique was found and used whereby an attacker can upload temporary image files against any POST endpoint and use them for the inclusion attack.

The vulnerability exists in the RdsLogsEntry servlet which accepts unauthenticated file uploads and handles zip file contents in an insecure way. By combining both weaknesses, a remote attacker can accomplish remote code execution. Note that this will only work if the target is running Java 6 or 7 up to 7u25, as Java 7u40 and above introduces a protection against null byte injection in file names. This module has been tested successfully on version v14.3.12 b22 and v14.4.32 b25 in Linux. In theory this module also works on Windows, but SysAid seems to bundle Java 7u40 and above with the Windows package which prevents the vulnerability from being exploited.",

It starts by querying the Admin server for the available applications, picks one, and then exploits it. You can also provide an application name to bypass this step, and exploit the application directly. The configuration overwrite is used to change an application server authentication method to \"CAM\", a proprietary IBM auth method, which is simulated by the exploit. The exploit then performs a fake authentication as admin, and finally abuses TM1 scripting to perform a command injection as root or SYSTEM. Testing was done on IBM PA 2.0.6 and IBM TM1 10.2.2 on Windows and Linux. Versions up to and including PA 2.0.8 are vulnerable. It is likely that versions earlier than TM1 10.2.2 are also vulnerable (10.2.2 was released in 2014).",

The Java Bridge is responsible for handling interactions between PHP and Java code within Zend Server. When Java code is encountered Zend Server communicates with the Java Bridge. The Java Bridge then handles the java code and creates the objects within the Java Virtual Machine. This interaction however, does not require any sort of authentication. This leaves the JVM wide open to remote attackers. Sending specially crafted data to the Java Bridge results in the execution of arbitrary java code.",

        "description": "This module exploits a heap buffer overflow within versions of Exim prior to version 4.69. By sending a specially crafted message, an attacker can corrupt the heap and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Exim daemon. The root cause is that no check is made to ensure that the buffer is not full prior to handling '%s' format specifiers within the 'string_vformat' function. In order to trigger this issue, we get our message rejected by sending a message that is too large. This will call into log_write to log rejection headers (which is a default configuration setting). After filling the buffer, a long header string is sent. In a successful attempt, it overwrites the ACL for the 'MAIL FROM' command. By sending a second message, the string we sent will be evaluated with 'expand_string' and arbitrary shell commands can be executed. It is likely that this issue could also be exploited using other techniques such as targeting in-band heap management structures, or perhaps even function pointers stored in the heap. However, these techniques would likely be far more platform specific, more complicated, and less reliable. This bug was original found and reported in December 2008, but was not properly handled as a security issue. Therefore, there was a 2 year lag time between when the issue was fixed and when it was discovered being exploited in the wild. At that point, the issue was assigned a CVE and began being addressed by downstream vendors. An additional vulnerability, CVE-2010-4345, was also used in the attack that led to the discovery of danger of this bug. This bug allows a local user to gain root privileges from the Exim user account. If the Perl interpreter is found on the remote system, this module will automatically exploit the secondary bug as well to get root.",

NetConfig is the Aerohive/Extreme Networks HiveOS administrative webinterface. Vulnerable versions allow for LFI because they rely on a version of PHP 5 that is vulnerable to string truncation attacks. This module leverages this issue in conjunction with log poisoning to gain RCE as root. Upon successful exploitation, the Aerohive NetConfig application will hang for as long as the spawned shell remains open. Closing the session should render the app responsive again. The module provides an automatic cleanup option to clean the log. However, this option is disabled by default because any modifications to the /tmp/messages log, even via sed, may render the target (temporarily) unexploitable. This state can last over an hour. This module has been successfully tested against Aerohive NetConfig versions 8.2r4 and 10.0r7a.",

The results of the injected commands are returned as part of the response from the web server. Affected versions include 2.7RC1, 2.7, and 2.8-403a. Other versions are likely affected as well. The default credentials used by Vicidial are VDCL/donotedit and VDAD/donotedit.",

The plugin uses the admin_init hook, which is also executed for unauthenticated users when accessing a specific URL. The first fix for this vulnerability appeared in version 2.6.7, but the fix can be bypassed. In PHP's default configuration, a POST variable overwrites a GET variable in the $_REQUEST array. The plugin uses $_REQUEST to check for access rights. By setting the POST parameter to something not beginning with 'wysija_', the check is bypassed. Wordpress uses the $_GET array to determine the page, so it is not affected by this. The developers applied the fixes to all previous versions too.",

By sending a specially crafted FTP PORT command, an attacker can corrupt stack memory and execute arbitrary code. This particular issue is caused by processing data bound by attacker controlled input while writing into a 4 byte stack buffer. Unfortunately, the writing that occurs is not a simple byte copy. Processing is done using a source ptr (p) and a destination pointer (q). The vulnerable function walks the input string and continues while the source byte is non-null. If a comma is encountered, the function increments the destination pointer. If an ascii digit [0-9] is encountered, the following occurs: *q = (*q * 10) + (*p - '0'); All other input characters are ignored in this loop. As a consequence, an attacker must craft input such that modifications to the current values on the stack result in usable values. In this exploit, the low two bytes of the return address are adjusted to point at the location of a 'call edi' instruction within the binary. This was chosen since 'edi' points at the source buffer when the function returns. NOTE: This server can be installed as a service using \"vftpd.exe install\". If so, the service does not restart automatically, giving an attacker only one attempt.",

The vulnerable code is within the option parsing function within \"ovwebsnmpsrv.exe\" with a timestamp prior to April 7th, 2010. Reaching the vulnerable code requires a 'POST' request with an 'arg' parameter that, when combined with some static text, exceeds 10240 bytes. The parameter must begin with a dash. It is important to note that this vulnerability must be exploited by overwriting SEH. This is since overflowing the buffer with controllable data always triggers an access violation when attempting to write static text beyond the end of the stack.

This module uses an attacker provided \"admin\" account to insert the malicious payload into the custom script fields. When a user resets their password or unlocks their account, the payload in the custom script will be executed. The payload will be executed as SYSTEM if ADSelfService Plus is installed as a service, which we believe is the normal operational behavior. This is a passive module because user interaction is required to trigger the payload. This module also does not automatically remove the malicious code from the remote target.

Code execution can be achieved by first uploading the payload to the remote machine as an exe file, and then upload another mof file, which enables WMI (Management Instrumentation service) to execute the uploaded payload. Please note that this module currently only works for Windows before Vista.",

Versions 7.2.6 and earlier and 9.0 and later are not affected. The vulnerability occurs due to Report.ashx's handler, located in Sitecore.Xdb.Client.dll under the Sitecore.sitecore.shell.ClientBin.Reporting.Report defintion, having a ProcessRequest() handler that calls ProcessReport() with the context of the attacker's request without properly checking if the attacker is authenticated or not. This request then causes ReportDataSerializer.DeserializeQuery() to be called, which will end up calling the DeserializeParameters() function of Sitecore.Analytics.Reporting.ReportDataSerializer, if a \"parameters\" XML tag is found in the attacker's request. Then for each subelement named \"parameter\", the code will check that it has a name and if it does, it will call NetDataContractSerializer().ReadObject on it. NetDataContractSerializer is vulnerable to deserialization attacks and can be trivially exploited by using the TypeConfuseDelegate gadget chain. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain arbitrary code execution as the user that IIS is running as, aka NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE. Users can then use technique 4 of the \"getsystem\" command to use RPCSS impersonation and get SYSTEM level code execution.",

        "description": "This module will execute an arbitrary payload on a Microsoft SQL Server, using a SQL injection vulnerability. Once a vulnerability is identified this module will use xp_cmdshell to upload and execute Metasploit payloads. It is necessary to specify the exact point where the SQL injection vulnerability happens. For example, given the following injection: http://www.example.com/show.asp?id=1;exec xp_cmdshell 'dir';--&cat=electrical you would need to set the following path: set GET_PATH /showproduct.asp?id=1;[SQLi];--&cat=foobar In regard to the payload, unless there is a closed port in the web server, you dont want to use any \"bind\" payload, specially on port 80, as you will stop reaching the vulnerable web server host. You want a \"reverse\" payload, probably to your port 80 or to any other outbound port allowed on the firewall. For privileged ports execute Metasploit msfconsole as root. Currently, three delivery methods are supported. First, the original method uses Windows 'debug.com'. File size restrictions are avoided by incorporating the debug bypass method presented by SecureStat at Defcon 17. Since this method invokes ntvdm, it is not available on x64 systems. A second method takes advantage of the Command Stager subsystem. This allows using various techniques, such as using a TFTP server, to send the executable. By default the Command Stager uses 'wcsript.exe' to generate the executable on the target. Finally, ReL1K's latest method utilizes PowerShell to transmit and recreate the payload on the target. NOTE: This module will leave a payload executable on the target system when the attack is finished.",

Consider using a command execution payload following the bind shell to restart the service if you need to reuse the same port.

This exploit uses 2606, the offset that creates the smallest overall payload. The other offset is 4654.

This return address works against all version of Windows and service packs. The last modification date on the library is dated 06/02/99. Assuming that the code where the overflow occurs has not changed in some time, prior version of SLMail may also be vulnerable with this exploit.

        "description": "This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in Timbuktu Pro version <= 8.6.6 in a pretty novel way. This exploit requires two connections. The first connection is used to leak stack data using the buffer overflow to overwrite the nNumberOfBytesToWrite argument. By supplying a large value for this argument it is possible to cause Timbuktu to reply to the initial request with leaked stack data. Using this data allows for reliable exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability. Props to Infamous41d for helping in finding this exploitation path. The second connection utilizes the data from the data leak to accurately exploit the stack based buffer overflow vulnerability. TODO: hdm suggested using meterpreter's migration capability and restarting the process for multishot exploitation.",
